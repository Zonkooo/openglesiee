
Two images are supplied with the app:

3dtech.tga: a image without alpha channel, the image data is only used for the heights
	
3dtech2.tga: an image with an alpha channel. The colors from the image are used for the vertex colors, whereas the alpha channel is used for the height.

The image loaded by the application is 3dtech.tga. 

If you want to try the other image just rename it to 3dtech.tga.

To navigate in the terrain you can use the mouse , or the left right keys, to orient the camera. To move the camera press the up/down keys. Note: if you press first the left mouse button the movement is ten times faster.
